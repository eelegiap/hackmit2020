# The Education Epidemic 
## Visualizing the barriers to remote learning during COVID-19

Using federal open-source data from the America Community Survey and the National Center for Education Statistics, we present interactive data visualizations to expose the many hidden barriers plaguing students attempting remote education. In doing so, we aim to reveal where and how these barriers exist. The barriers we focused on included a lack of access to technology (such as high-speed internet and computers), access to environments conducive to studying, and food insecurity.

Explore our choropleths to see how these barriers are affecting millions of students, at both a state and county level.
